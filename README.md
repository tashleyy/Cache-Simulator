# EE352 Final Project

Run in MARS

I implemented the simulation with set associativity and an LRU replacement policy.

To run the simulation in MARS:
 - Open the Mars.jar inside this folder, then open the .asm file
 - Run as normal (Assemble > Go)

To run the simulation in Java:
 - Compile with `javac EE352_Final_Tjahjadi.java`
 - Run with `java EE352_Final_Tjahjadi`

The trace.txt will be randomly generated by the Java program before simulation.
You can use the same trace.txt for the MIPS program.
You can also use your own trace.txt for the MIPS simulation. Each 32-bit hexadecimal memory address must be on its own line. Each memory address must have 8 digits. At the end of the file, put a "Z" on a new line to signify the end.
The Java program automatically generates a compatible trace.txt.
